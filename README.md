BRICKst
=======

Say hi to yet another (S)CSS framework. BRICKst is (heavily) inspired by ZURB's Foundation, takes the best of code and philosophy, applies it in minimal fashion and some little tweaks, which I found useful.

BRICKst is constantly in development, however slow the progress may be. I'm gradually building smaller projects on it and therefore adding missing features in the meantime.

All code tweaks, little hacks and stuff are appreciated (e.g. in case you find some unfitting solution).
